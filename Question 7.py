Ubbi Dubbi - Add "ub" and "dub" Alternately Before Vowels in the Text
Given a text file containing lowercase letters, modify the text such that:

Before each vowel, add the string "ub" if it is the first or an odd-numbered vowel encountered.
Add "dub" before the vowel if it is the second or an even-numbered vowel encountered.
Preserve the text's original formatting, including spaces and newlines.
Assume the input text is all lowercase and may have multiple lines.

NOTE: This is a file-in-stdout type question where the input is read from the file and the output is printed in the standard output.
