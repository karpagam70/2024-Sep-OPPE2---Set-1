'''
Check if the given element is present in opposite halves
Write a function is_present_in_opposite_halves(elem, l1: list, l2: list) that checks whether the given elem is present in opposite halves of the two lists l1 and l2.
The function should return True if the element exists in one half of l1 and in the opposite half of l2, and False otherwise.

Note that both the below cases are valid and evaluate to True.

elem in the first half of l1 and second half of l2
elem in the second half of l1 and first half of l2
Assume both lists l1 and l2 have even lengths.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Examples

is_present_in_opposite_halves(3, [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 3, 8]) -> False
Explanation: 3 is in the second half of l1 and the second half of l2.
is_present_in_opposite_halves(7, [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 3, 8]) -> False
Explanation: 7 is not in l1 or l2.
is_present_in_opposite_halves(6, [5, 6, 7, 8], [1, 2, 6, 4]) -> True
Explanation: 6 is in the first half of l1 and the second half of l2.
is_present_in_opposite_halves(6, [5, 7, 6, 8], [1, 6, 2, 4]) -> True
Explanation: 6 is in the second half of l1 and the first half of l2.
